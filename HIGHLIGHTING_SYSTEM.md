# FactChecker Pro - New Highlighting System

## 🎯 **What's New: Color-Coded Fact Checking**

The extension now provides **visual fact-checking** with color-coded underlines and accuracy scores, similar to Grammarly's grammar checking but for factual accuracy.

## 🎨 **Color-Coded Underlines**

### **🟢 Green Underlines - Accurate Facts**
- **When**: Facts verified as accurate (confidence > 70%)
- **Examples**: 
  - "Stanford University was founded in 1885" ✅
  - "The US declared independence on July 4, 1776" ✅
  - "China has a population of over 1.4 billion people" ✅

### **🔴 Red Underlines - Inaccurate Facts**
- **When**: Facts found to be false or inaccurate (confidence < 50%)
- **Examples**:
  - "100% of people believe everything on the internet" ❌
  - "All politicians are corrupt" ❌
  - "The Earth is flat" ❌

### **🟡 Yellow Underlines - Mixed/Unclear Facts**
- **When**: Facts with mixed accuracy or unclear verification (confidence 40-70%)
- **Examples**:
  - "Studies show coffee makes you live longer" ⚠️
  - "Apple products are always more expensive" ⚠️

### **⚫ Gray Underlines - Unverified Facts**
- **When**: Facts that couldn't be verified with available sources
- **Examples**:
  - "Nobody has ever succeeded without working hard" ❓
  - "Every person who exercises lives to 100" ❓

## 📊 **Hover Tooltips with Accuracy Scores**

When you hover over any underlined fact, you'll see:

### **🎯 Accuracy Score**
- **High (80%+)**: Green badge with "Accurate"
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Yellow badge with "Likely Accurate"  
- **Low (40-59%)**: Orange badge with "Mixed/Unclear"
- **Very Low (<40%)**: Red badge with "Inaccurate"

### **📋 Detailed Information**
- **Issues Found**: Specific problems with the fact
- **Suggestions**: How to improve or verify the statement
- **Sources**: Which fact-checking services were used
- **Explanation**: Brief summary of the verification

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **1. Fact Detection**
The extension scans web pages for factual statements using pattern matching:
- Statistics and percentages
- Historical dates and events
- Research claims ("studies show")
- Absolute statements ("always", "never")
- Institutional references
- Comparative claims

### **2. Multi-Source Verification**
Each fact is checked against multiple sources:
- **Wikipedia API**: Historical facts, institutions
- **World Bank API**: Economic statistics
- **Google Fact Check API**: General verification (if configured)
- **OpenAI API**: Complex analysis (if configured)

### **3. Accuracy Scoring**
Facts receive confidence scores based on:
- Source reliability (Wikipedia: 70%, World Bank: 80%, etc.)
- Verification success rate
- Data consistency across sources
- Recency of information

### **4. Visual Highlighting**
Based on confidence scores:
- **>70% confidence + no issues** = Green underline
- **<50% confidence + issues** = Red underline  
- **40-70% confidence** = Yellow underline
- **<40% confidence + no sources** = Gray underline

## 🎯 **User Experience**

1. **Load the extension** and browse normally
2. **See color-coded underlines** appear under factual statements
3. **Hover over underlines** to see accuracy scores and details
